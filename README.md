## Overview
Previously, I did this callenge and made a lot of errors, which you can see on my github account. Because my website wasn't responsive and I'd locked the height, the page collapsed and wrapped to the following row. I utilized Grid CSS and Flexbox combined to solve this challenge, created this site mobile-first, and included media queries for large displays. I utilized the appropriate CSS units and lowered the font size; I'll provide the link below to guide you through Css Units. I hope my solution will be helpful to you. If I made a mistake, kindly remark. I've come here to study.

### The challenge

At the end of this challange I am Able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on the device's screen size.
